    "## 📊 Customer Complaint Intelligence — NLP & Trend Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook analyzes customer complaints and call logs to discover recurring issues and detect trends over time. The emphasis is on extracting meaningful keywords and two-word phrases (bigrams) from free-text complaint descriptions so we can understand what customers actually complain about (e.g., \"hidden charges\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Key steps you'll see below:\n",
    "- Load data from a local MySQL database into pandas.\n",
    "- Basic cleaning and deduplication of records.\n",
    "- Extract top single-word keywords (after removing stopwords).\n",
    "- Build and rank bigrams (meaningful 2-word phrases) to add context.\n",
    "- Group and analyze counts by category and by month to see trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes: examples in this notebook are safe to run in a local environment with access to the database and the required Python packages."
