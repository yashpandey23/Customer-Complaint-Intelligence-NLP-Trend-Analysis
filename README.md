# Customer-Complaint-Intelligence-NLP-Trend-Analysis
In the Fintech industry, understanding why customers are calling support is crucial for reducing churn and improving products. This project analyzes a dataset of customer complaints, call logs, and user information to identify the root causes of dissatisfaction.
Data is just noise until you find the pattern. 💡

I’ve been working on a new Customer Intelligence project to analyze support tickets for a fintech scenario. Instead of just counting how many complaints we received, I wanted to know exactly what customers were saying.

🛠️ The Tech Stack:

Python (Pandas/NumPy): for heavy lifting and data cleaning.

SQL (SQLAlchemy): to pull data directly from the database.

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): to strip away noise and "stop words."

🚀 The Approach: I built a logic to extract Bigrams (two-word pairs). Why? Because the word "payment" is vague. But "payment failed" or "hidden charges" tells a story. By analyzing these pairs, I was able to rank the most frequent pain points and track them month-over-month.

📉 What’s Next? The analysis is done, and the numbers are in. Next, I’ll be visualizing this data using Matplotlib to show the trends visually.

Stay tuned for the charts! 📊
